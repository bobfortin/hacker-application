My rationale for lack of the same stems from the fact as a senior level manager my focus has been more on the day-to-day business and not focused on writing code or building any specific environments to support.  I do not have any objections of learning or setting up these environemnts if needed however, I have not needed to be in this position for quite sometime.

I am comfortable working in any environment necessary and over my career have working in Unix and Windows environemnts and also use a Apple platform for home use.

I hope this helps to answer the 'b' portion of the question.

Thank you,
bob

Experienced developers, particularly those working in a Unix environment, tend to prefer
tools which afford a measure of customization. The standard Unix approach of dotfiles to
customize editors, shells, IRC clients, and the like to the developers liking is something
we're interested in.

In this directory, please include (at your option) either:

  a) A sampling of dotfiles or other configuration from your working environment.

  b) A rationale for your lack of same (complete with some description of your
     preferred working environment).
