Please answer the following general questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range? (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with to the most you think you're worth.)

-- In my last position I was making $137,500 with a 15% bonus ($158,125) based on Management Business Objectives that was paid on a quarterly basis.  I also had Stock Options in the company.  I would be comfortable anywhere in that range and should there be some tension with that range I would be happy to have a conversation to discuss what might a reasonable compensation.

2. When can you start?

--  I currently am working on a project and have a commitment through the end of March.  I expect that I would be able to start full-time in early April.

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next six months that we should know about?

--  Not currently however, I usually take off for a week or so in early Q4 to get away with my family for a bit.

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working aroung dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing dogs to work?

--  I have no issues working around dogs, I actually prefer it.  I am not currently a dog owner however, my wife and I have been considering adding a dog to our family.

5. The active developer keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?

-- I look at Stack Overflow.  Watch Linked In for posts on Technologies and also discuss new technologies coming up with Vendors that I have built relationships with over the years.

6. The sane developer does things other than writing code. What else occupies your time?

-- My family, love to cook, have a small wine cellar, vegetable gardening, travel when we have the opportunity, hiking, snowshoeing.

7. The worldy developer is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?

-- My wife and I enjoy movies, as well as Plays and my wife loves the Opera which she is trying to influence me. We also try to to catch a number of cultural exhibits when they are availabe in the area.

8. Please critique any of the SparkFun websites. With influence over the SparkFun dev team what would *you* focus on improving?

-- The biggest item that I have found is that data.sparkfun.com leaves the current master site and does not provide the user with a way back.  I would recommend opening this portion of the site in a new target or providing a link back to the master site.

-- https://forum.sparkfun.com I would also recommend opening in a new target.  It takes the user away from the main site.
